# Azure

In here I will be adding all different labs and projects related to Azure.

Labs:
- [Create VM + Web Server](https://github.com/DanielDominguezBender/Azure/tree/main/Create%20VM%20%2B%20Webserver)<br>
On this lab I will create a VM machine and run a web server that will be accessible via a public ip assigned by Azure. I have split this lab in 3 parts:<br>
1. Creation of VM machine<br>
2. Connection to VM machine via RDP<br>
3. Install the web server and access it<br><br>

- [Azure Sentinel]()<br>
On this lab I created a Honeypod in Azure Sentinel and showed the attacks on a Worldmap / Headmap.
